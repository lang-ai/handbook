# How We Work

## Cycles

We work in cycles of one month. This way we constraint ourselves to have shippable releases in each iteration. It doesn’t mean that every feature will take one month of work, but it helps us reduce the scope or divide a project into pieces of work that can be presented.

The product team starts by making an initial selection of the work we will be tackling in the next iteration. This proposal is then shared with the rest of the team and iterated until the specifications and scopes are well defined. The development team involvement is especially relevant here.

## Communication

### Daily

The product team use the #daily Slack room to share the main tasks they will tackle that day. This is especially useful to discover blockers and have a clear picture of how we are moving towards our weekly goals.

Although is not mandatory to do it every day, it’s recommended to share your plans at least twice a week.

### Weekly

#### All-hands meeting

Each Monday, everyone joins an all-hands meeting where each team shares the objectives for their week. We also briefly talk about new hires, clients, and product updates. The sales team also gives an update about the most interesting clients meeting from the previous and the next week. All the information along with the monthly objectives are centralized in a shared document.

The main objective is to keep the team aligned around the goals, as well as to maintain transparency on how the company is doing.

#### Team-specific meeting

The Product team gathers in a 20-min video call to discuss on the blockers and progress for the monthly objectives, while the Data Science team gathers a 45-min video call focused on the ongoing tasks. The Sales team meets on Friday to discuss the status of opportunities and challenges found.

## Health Monitor

We run our [Health Monitor](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/health-monitor) exercise every two months as a checkpoint to see how we are doing across eight attributes common amongst healthy teams.

## Asynchronously

Lang.ai is a remote-friendly company. This means that although we are not fully remote, our culture is closer to what a remote-only company aims for. This includes the following principles:

- Flexible working hours over set working hours.
- Writing down and recording knowledge over oral explanations.
- Written down processes over on-the-job training.
- Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.
- Opening every document to change by anyone over top down control of documents.
- [Asynchronous communication](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/) over synchronous communication.
- The results of work over the hours put in.
- Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.
