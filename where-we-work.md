# Where We Work

Most of our team works from our main offices in Madrid, but not all of them go there every day. The product team that lives there aims to gather at least twice a month in the office.

Here are some of the examples on where people work: Jorge lives in San Francisco, and he travels frequently. Enrique is currently working from Washington. The product team works from home two to three days a week, and Alex from Engineering comes to the office once every two weeks. The Data Science team also work from home occasionally.
