# Making a Career

We have defined a fair compensation plan for technical and business profiles, based on a fixed salary and stocks.

We deeply studied the spanish labour market to define the salary bands and we decided to make them totally public. We consider that it makes our compensation plan more transparent and objective. We avoid any type of favoritism, wage gap, initial negotiations and other biases.

The stocks are divided based on the moment when you joined the company, position, responsibility and personal preferences of the team, since workers could choose to have less base salary and more stocks and vice versa.

We also defined an annual salary review plan based on two criteria: time in the company and position/new responsibilities.
