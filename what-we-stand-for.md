# What We Stand For

## Mission

Communication and language are the backbone of human interactions and therefore the backbone of companies. We want Lang.ai to enable scalability in processes that deal with text as 80% of companies data is unstructured, helping people solve problems, save time and focus on what really adds value in their work.

We believe communication should be free, open and people should be able to speak in their mother tongue or language of choice. We believe people shouldn’t try to adapt their language or limit their vocabulary so that machines can understand it. AI should understand communication as it is.

## Company values

### Constant disruption

We sell things we have not built yet: we believe great products are constantly improved by listening and being creative, understanding what the market and customers need.

### Innovation

We build things we won’t sell yet: we believe in investing in the problems future will hold by spending time with research. We're here for the long run, not for a quick win.

### Results-oriented

We are cashflow-driven: we believe in the power of a company that makes money and the value of clients that pay. Work is paid.

### Transparency and communication

We are adults: we want people that are transparent, that communicate their aspirations and worries and that are adults in their behavior.

## Inclusivity and teamwork

We don’t believe in fake hierarchies: we want others to grow. We are happy by the success of others and work together to reach a goal, as long as their goal is inclusive with the rest of the team. A leader leads, not rules.

## Work and team values

The starting team of people that initiated Lang.ai project has defined these values and what they represent in the team based on how the team works and collaborates. Below you will see quotes from our team.

### 1. Trust & Teamwork

Everyone is as important doing their piece of the work. Collaboration is key.

Key concepts:

- You trust your teammates will do his best to perform his work
- The team goals are your goals and you help the team reach those goals
- You are result-oriented and you execute a strategy to reach a goal
- There are no individual goals but we divide the work based on expertise and there are team goals that we all pursue

How the team sees that we work under this value:

> I fully rely on components developed by other people in the team in the intent induction pipeline

> Possibility of working remotely and having constant and instant communication with your teammates

> I can make an evaluation mistake without fear of retorsion

> Feeling confident while working in complex projects where you rely on multiple people working on their own areas

> Trust what other teams work and help each other to provide solutions in complex situations

### 2. Transparency & Communication

Be as much transparent as you can as long as you are respectful of people’s right of privacy.

Key concepts:

- We are all in this together with a goal and a process to reach our goal. We understand there may be certain challenges along the way. Be transparent about them and discuss them with your colleagues
- Communicate about your worries, your personal and professional goals with your peers and leaders
- Communicate with your peers and leaders if you think they are not doing something well. It doesn’t help the team to make mistakes and not everyone may see what you see.

Transparency and communication within the team:

- We believe that transparency also leads to empathy and understanding what others have to cope with in their work, share their challenges and their success is the path to a better team
- We share new commercial updates so that everyone can be involved and understand where the market is going
- Share product and DS updates so that everyone can be involved and understand where our product is going
- Share product plans and roadmap
- Share commercial plans and roadmap
- Compensation plans are public
- Our budget and P&L are public to all team
- Most relevant decisions regarding budget allocation involve different people in the team

How the team see that we work under this value:

> Sales meeting results are shared. We can ship functionalities from key sales meetings in weeks, our reaction time is great thanks to communication between sales and technical team.

> Spend time on knowing what are the rest of the teams working on

> Being able to directly speak to any role in the company, including CEO, CTO, etc.

### 3. Innovation & Entrepreneurship

Constantly try to make things better.

Key concepts:

- Lang.ai started as a project inside another company. Any idea is valuable to build a new product or to improve a process. Communicate your ideas.
- Always try to question the status-quo and how you can bring something to the next level. Industries and products can change along years with the current speed of technology, don’t be afraid.

How the team sees that we work under this value:

> At DS we have the opportunity to pursue our ideas and see how far they can go. We have the time and help to do that. It's a risk but also a great chance to achieve something special

> Lang.ai is the result of a collective innovation effort, and we should always favor that kind of innovation

> Be able to provide solutions "out of the box"

### 4. Excellence & Ambition

Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds.

Key concepts:

- Excellence doesn’t mean perfection. We iterate and we iterate fast, because excellence in a fast moving market means you have to move together with the market. If a client needs a functionality, excellence means having a minimum version of that functionality in the shortest amount of time!
- Be good and precise at your work. Measure yourself, define goals and try to reach them
- Be ambitious, dream big. Always try to improve what you are doing and the results our team can achieve with your work being critical for that mission.
- Listen to feedback mostly from customers or peers to make the product better. Listening is the key to excellence in our work.
- My commitment to achieve something is not only for the things I'll do, but for the things I accept to stop doing now. I prioritize a roadmap, I want to do everything but I assume a trade-off between different features I want to ship first.
- I assume a certain quality in my work: sometimes I do it perfectly, sometimes it is better to ship it as "it works" assuming that it will penalize you in the future (when you have to revisit it and basically rebuild what you did)

How the team sees that we work under this value:

> We all want to make things better. It's inside us. We look for excellence in anything we do

> When we see a functionality that several key clients need, we sell them the idea in days in an Invision prototype and ship it ASAP as if we already had most of it developed. Our reaction time and team hackathon mode is unique.

> At DS we have the opportunity to pursue our ideas and see how far they can go. We have the time and help to do that. It's a risk but also a great chance to achieve something special

> Work/Research on cutting edge technologies, which may allow us to participate in important conferences and workshops

> We care to spend time to make out product the best. Good enough is not enough

> Not being afraid of facing complex and new projects, At the same time, we can acknowledge their feasibility and review it at any time
